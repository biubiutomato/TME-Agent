## 📁 Case Study Inputs

The `cases/` folder contains the input user utterances for four multi-turn interactive scenarios used in our TME-DAG paper:

- `trip_planning_case.json` – Revisions, checks, and flight planning.
- `cooking_case.json` – Shared ingredient substitutions across tasks.
- `meeting_scheduling_case.json` – Participant conflicts and meeting consolidation.
- `cart_editing_case.json` – Sequential add/remove/reset operations.

Each JSON file is a list of user utterances that simulate one full task interaction session.

> Note: Future versions will restructure these into subfolders per case to include outputs, parsed graphs, and evaluation annotations.
