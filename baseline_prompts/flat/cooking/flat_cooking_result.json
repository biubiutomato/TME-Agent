    "gpt_reply": "To make soup, start by washing the celery thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris. Once clean, place the celery on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to trim off the ends. Then, chop the celery into small, even pieces according to your recipe's requirements. Chopped celery is often used as part of a mirepoix (a combination of onions, carrots, and celery) to form the flavorful base of many soups. After chopping, you can sauté the celery with other vegetables or add it directly to your soup pot along with other ingredients.",

    "gpt_reply": "To make dumplings with tomatoes and shrimp, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Chop Tomatoes:**\n   - Start by washing the tomatoes thoroughly.\n   - Remove the core and any blemishes.\n   - Chop the tomatoes into small, even pieces. You can remove the seeds if you prefer a less watery filling.\n\n2. **Peel and Chop Shrimp:**\n   - Begin by rinsing the shrimp under cold water.\n   - Peel the shrimp by removing the shell. You can do this by pulling off the legs and then peeling back the shell. If the shrimp are not pre-deveined, you may want to remove the vein by making a shallow cut along the back and pulling it out.\n   - Chop the peeled shrimp into small pieces suitable for your dumpling filling.\n\n3. **Prepare the Filling:**\n   - In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes and shrimp.\n   - You can add other ingredients to enhance the flavor, such as minced garlic, chopped green onions, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper.\n   - Mix everything thoroughly to ensure the ingredients are well combined.\n\n4. **Assemble the Dumplings:**\n   - Place a dumpling wrapper on a flat surface.\n   - Spoon a small amount of the filling mixture into the center of the wrapper.\n   - Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water, then fold and seal the dumpling by pinching the edges together. You can pleat the edges for a traditional look.\n\n5. **Cook the Dumplings:**\n   - You can steam, boil, or pan-fry the dumplings depending on your preference.\n   - For steaming, place the dumplings in a steamer basket over boiling water and cook for about 8-10 minutes.\n   - For boiling, drop the dumplings into a pot of boiling water and cook until they float to the top and are cooked through, about 4-6 minutes.\n   - For pan-frying, heat a bit of oil in a pan, add the dumplings, and cook until the bottoms are golden brown. Then add a splash of water, cover, and let them steam until cooked through.\n\nEnjoy your homemade dumplings with your choice of dipping sauce!",

The smaller the pieces, the better they will blend into the dumpling filling.\n\n2. **Prepare the Filling:**\n   - In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes, shrimp, and celery.\n   - Add additional flavorings such as minced garlic, chopped green onions, grated ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper to taste.\n   - Mix all the ingredients thoroughly to ensure an even distribution of flavors.\n\n3. **Assemble the Dumplings:**\n   - Place a dumpling wrapper on a flat surface.\n   - Spoon a small amount of the filling mixture into the center of the wrapper.\n   - Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water to help seal it.\n   - Fold the wrapper over the filling to form a half-moon shape, then press and pleat the edges to seal securely.\n\n4. **Cook the Dumplings:**\n   - Choose your preferred cooking method: steaming, boiling, or pan-frying.\n   - For steaming, place the dumplings in a steamer basket over boiling water and steam for about 8-10 minutes.\n   - For boiling, drop the dumplings into a pot of boiling water and cook until they float to the top and are cooked through, about 4-6 minutes.\n   - For pan-frying, heat some oil in a pan, add the dumplings, and cook until the bottoms are golden brown. Add a splash of water, cover, and let them steam until fully cooked.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the dumplings hot with your choice of dipping sauce, such as soy sauce, chili oil, or a vinegar-based sauce.\n\nBy adding celery, you'll introduce a nice crunch and a fresh flavor to your dumplings, complementing the shrimp and tomatoes.
